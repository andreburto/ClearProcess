CLEARPROCESS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This app will clear out the table records so a student can begin the
registration process again. Id there are any errors in the SFTREGS
table the app will report them and halt the clearing process.

This is a quick'n'dirty app that is still being developed. To use it
the compiled executable will need to be run in the same folder as the
execuatble for either Linka or OraTest3.

Requirements for ClearProcess are as follows:

* Microsoft .NET 4.0

* Oracle Data Profider for .NET
